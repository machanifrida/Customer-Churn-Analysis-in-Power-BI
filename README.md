# Customer-Churn-Analysis-in-Power-BI
I analyzed customer churn using Power BI. My insights include: 

1. Most churners are citing competitor reasons. This should be investigated further.
2. The state of California has a massive churn rate and this is mostly associated with customers who do not have an international plan but do make international calls. This information is important for the company has it can help the company to make a good decision while allocating its budget for the new promotion. These people without a plan can be potential clients for the new promotion of the international plan.
3. Customers who pay for an international plan but do not make international calls are also churning at a higher rate. These customers should be offered to downgrade their plan which might help to retain them.
4. Moving customers to a one- or two-year contract could greatly reduce churn because customers who have monthly contracts churn more than customers who have yearly contracts.
